# Advancing Transit Equity Through Geospatial and Statistical Analysis (MIT 8th Annual Policy Hackathon)

This repository contains a Python-based statistical and QGIS geospatial analysis of transit inequity across four major U.S. cities: Boston, Washington DC, New York City, and Seattle. Using U.S. Census block-group datasets from 2019 to 2023 and custom demographic GeoPackages that were built for each city, the notebook quantifies poverty levels, extreme commute burden, and the statistical relationships between these variables.

The full analysis is implemented in a single, self-contained Jupyter Notebook:
- `Advancing_Transit_Inequity_Robin.ipynb`
